## Background

**Endometriosis** is an understudied and painful condition impacting 10% of women globally [1]. 
Research suggests an average of 8 years until diagnosis due to a lack of understanding of the disease [2]. It is defined by uterine tissue growth outside of the uterus. Those affected by endometriosis are at a higher risk of gynecologic cancers.

**Ovarian cancer** is the most common endometriosis-associated cancers [3], as well as the most lethal across gynecologic cancers. Many endometriosis hallmarks are shared with cancer hallmarks: angiogenesis, proliferation, evading the immune system, adhering, metastsis (according to one of the two pathogensis hypotheses) [4].

The hallmarks of endometriosis seem to be shared with those of cancer. Our project aims to answer the question of whether machine learning can help us infer blood-detectable proteins (using scRNA-seq data) that are either conserved or divergent across both conditions. 

This is a capstone project of the Data Science and AI bootcamp with neue fische GmbH. The idea here is that a stakeholder in bio-tech has asked for a blood-detectable protein panel that can distinguish between healthy patients and patients with either endometriosis or ovarian cancer. The idea here is that a blood test can be conducted preliminary to the highly invasive and painful diagnostic measures (intravaginal imaging, biopsies, etc.).

## Data
| Condition| Dataset | Size | Patients | Cell Count| Cell Count post ETL |
| -------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Ovarian Endometriosis  |  GEO214411 | 1.5 gb | 6 endometriosis, 7 controls | 155361| 61031|
| Ovarian Cancer | GSE184880  | 0.5 gb | 7 cancer, 5 controls | 65820 | 32520|

## Methodologies
### Data Allocation and Preprocessing
Single-cell RNA sequencing data was allocated from relevant publications. Both the ovarian cancer and the endometriosis datasets were retreived from the Gene Expression Ominobus database. The data required reformating and cleaning. 
### Data Integration
In order to regress out technical variations coming from the datasets and the samples, scVI was used. We chose scVI as it can batch correct the gene expression matrices. Other common integrative tools work primarily on the latent dimensional spaces. 

### Machine Learning 
Due to the short time of the project (a month), we were only able to train an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) model. Hyperparameters are available in the ML notebook. 

## Requirements
* pyenv with Python: 3.11.3
* Further package requirements are included as .txt files. To set up the virtual environment for the ETL stage:
### **`macOS`** type the following commands : 
- Install the virtual environment and the required packages by following commands:

    ```BASH
    pyenv local 3.11.3
    python3 -m venv .venv_ETL
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements_ETL.txt #choose the correct .txt file
    ```
### **`Windows`** type the following commands :

- Install the virtual environment and the required packages by following commands.

   For `PowerShell` CLI :

    ```PowerShell
    pyenv local 3.11.3
    python -m venv .venv_ETL
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements_ETL.txt #choose the correct .txt file
    ```

    For `Git-bash` CLI :
  
    ```BASH
    pyenv local 3.11.3
    python -m venv .venv_ETL
    source .venv/Scripts/activate
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements_ETL.txt #choose the correct .txt file
    ```
